## Conclusion
Social commerce and conversational commerce, or sales through interactive chat and message 
channels with customers in the Internet environment, have grown in popularity.

Brands may begin concentrating on social commerce and conversational commerce in the 
future, with the potential to achieve two to three times the effect by leveraging the trend.

The impact of COVID-19 on consumption and purchasing behavior will be long-lasting, and 
companies must prepare for the new digital normal in the post-pandemic phase.

We should keep COVID-19's behavioral shifts in mind, and rethink supply chains to digitally 
service customers and deliver to their homes.
